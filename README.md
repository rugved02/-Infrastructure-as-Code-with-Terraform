# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
## Dev-Ops Internship Task-3

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform** to provision and manage a **Docker container** locally on an EC2 instance.  
The goal was to learn how to automate infrastructure setup, manage it declaratively, and cleanly destroy it when no longer needed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Provision a local Docker container using Terraform.
- Understand the Terraform workflow: `init`, `plan`, `apply`, `state`, and `destroy`.
- Store execution logs for documentation and review.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Terraform** â€“ Infrastructure as Code tool.
- **Docker** â€“ Container platform for running applications.
- **AWS EC2** â€“ Linux instance to run Terraform & Docker.
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** â€“ Operating system used in EC2.
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ For version control and code hosting.
